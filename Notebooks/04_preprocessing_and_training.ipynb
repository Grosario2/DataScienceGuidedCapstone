    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "* It's a good idea to start by calculating the average price. This is a straightforward and intuitive task. However, after using various metric techniques like R-squared, mean absolute error, and mean squared error, we found that our average ticket price would be off by around 19 usd. Therefore, we realized that we needed to do more than just calculate the average price, and we went ahead to build our models. \n",

    "- Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We started by using the Linear Regression model (LR) and filled in the missing values with the median and mean of the train split. We then applied these values to the test split to compare the model performance between them. Once the missing data was filled in, we scaled and transformed the data, and used it to train the model with the train split. Next, we predicted the ticket prices using the train and test split. By comparing the predicted values, we were able to assess the model performance using three primary metrics. The results were much better than those obtained using only the average ticket price.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A more efficient way to find the best \"k\" value is to use the \"cross-validation\" technique. This involves dividing the training model into k-1 folds and evaluating the performance on the fold that was not used for training. This technique was consistent with the result performance on the test split. \n",

    "* The next model used, which can work very well in a lot of regression cases, was the Random Forest model (RF). Using RF hyperparameters we were able to quickly assess the best preprocessing method to apply to our data, which were {'randomforestregressor__n_estimators': 69, 'simpleimputer__strategy': 'median', 'standardscaler': None}. The estimated performance using cross-validation was marginally improved upon the previous CV results, and it was consistent with the test set. \n",
